## Getting Started
- You need to have Jupyter Notebook installed in your system

### First Method: Downloading the ZIP file (Recommended)
- Click the green "Code" button in the top of the page (right side next to "About")
- Click Download ZIP and extract the ZIP
- Open Jupyter Notebook
- Navigate to the downloaded folder
- Open the files you want to see

### Second Method: Cloning the Repository
- Open Git Bash
- Using the cd command, navigate to the directory you want the repository to be cloned on
- Type git clone "https://github.com/oswaldoosw/Machine_Learning_Projects.git"
- Open Jupyter Notebook
- Navigate to the cloned folder
- Open the files you want to see
- 
These notebooks document the inputs and outputs of my session, so you don't have to re-run the files. If you want to run the files, you might have to do some package installations if you haven't done so. I have listed the commands to install the required packages for each project, but they may be incomplete as I didn't document what I have installed on my local computer. If an error regarding missing packages pops up, install the missing packages.
